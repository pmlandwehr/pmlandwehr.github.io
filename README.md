A simple website that says "howdy!" to the world. Someday perhaps I'll replace it with something using [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), or some other static site generator. Perhaps I'll finish stealing [Indexhibit's](https://www.indexhibit.org/) most excellent clean-looking style. But for now this is pretty dang fine.
